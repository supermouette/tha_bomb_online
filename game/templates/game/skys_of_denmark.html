        <p>During my precious days in denmark, I was able to witness the great diversity of denmark skys during the day.</p>
        <p> I take one high resolution photo of the sky everyday. You have here every photo of the month.</p>
        <p> The prevision image was computer-generated with a complex neural network.</p>
